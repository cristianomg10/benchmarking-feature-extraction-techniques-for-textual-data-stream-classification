# Benchmarking Feature Extraction Techniques for Textual Data Stream Classification

This repo regards the paper [1]. In this paper, we evaluated three four representation approaches, i.e., BERT[2], Word2Vec [3], Hashing Trick [4], and Incremental Word-Vectors [5]. These approaches were evaluated considering accuracy and run time, considering different stream lengths, i.e., 10k, 20k, 30k, 50k, 100k, 200k. Also, two datasets were used in the evaluation: Sentiment140 and Yelp dataset.

The results are stored in (this file)[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S2RERdbW9Cxt-GwlcmeAPPtxsxjDDhJfV13Nh-KfAUc/edit?usp=sharing].
